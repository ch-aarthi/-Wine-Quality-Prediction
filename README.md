# -Wine-Quality-Prediction
The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, demonstrating a real-world application of machine learning in the field of viticulture.

The dataset includes several chemical features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and more, which are used to classify wines into quality categories.

üìå **Project Overview**

Goal: Predict wine quality using chemical composition data.

Dataset: Wine Quality Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

Features: Chemical properties of wine (e.g., density, acidity).

Target: Wine quality score (integer values).
